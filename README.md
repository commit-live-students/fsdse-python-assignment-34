# Write a Python program to get a list, sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple from a given list of non-empty tuples.

Sample List : [(2, 5), (1, 2), (4, 4), (2, 3), (2, 1)]

Expected Result : [(2, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 4), (2, 5)]

**Nodes:**
* Define a function to accept list of tuples as parameter.
* For each tuple get last element and sort list according to ascending order of last element in tuples.
* Return sorted list.
